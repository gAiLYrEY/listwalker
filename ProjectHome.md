## Description ##
listwalker is a simple todo list application built using jQuery and CodeIgniter.

Version: 0.5

Coming soon:
  * Saved lists
  * Email functionality

---


## Installation ##
  * You need Apache running PHP5
  * Edit /index.php (line 43) to list your server's application path
  * Edit /application/config/app\_config.php (line 14) to list your domain application path

## Notes ##
  * listwalker has only been initially tested in Firefox and Opera on linux. A-grade browser support per Yahoo! standards will be included in v1.0.
  * Unlike a default CodeIgniter setup, I have pulled the application directory out of system. With application no longer a subdirectory of system, upgrading your version of CodeIgniter should be easier. The result is that you need to edit line 43 of index.php as described in the Installation section.
  * This repository currently contains CodeIgniter v1.71
